## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites

To run this application you need [Python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

### Local Setup

Clone the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aqche/flaskeddit.git
```

Setup a `venv` and use `pip` to install the project dependencies.

```sh
cd flaskeddit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable, create the SQLite database, and start the app. Now you can give the application a try at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)!

```sh
export FLASK_APP=flaskeddit.py
flask cli create_db
flask run
```

You can also serve the application locally using [gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/).

```sh
gunicorn "flaskeddit:create_app()"
```

## Testing

Flaskeddit is tested using pytest.

Use `pytest` to run the application's tests.

```sh
pytest
```

## Deployment

Flaskeddit is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). To set up the required infrastructure for the project, you can use the [terraform-heroku-app-postgres](https://github.com/aqche/terraform-heroku-app-postgres) Terraform module.

```hcl
module "terraform-heroku-app-postgres" {
  source                = "github.com/aqche/terraform-heroku-app-postgres.git"
  name                  = "heroku-app-name"
  sensitive_config_vars = {
      SECRET_KEY = "<secret_key>"
  }
}
```

The application is automatically deployed using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

You can also use `git` to manually deploy the application.

```sh
export HEROKU_API_KEY="heroku_api_key"
export HEROKU_APP_NAME="heroku_app_name"
git push https://heroku:$HEROKU_API_KEY@git.heroku.com/$HEROKU_APP_NAME.git master
```
